# 1.20.1-Forge-Basic-pack
This basic modpack is created for me to develop other pack or server.

Of course, you could use this template repository.

If you have any questions, please create a issue.

What's more, this development environment is based on [Hello Minecraft! Laucher](https://hmcl.huangyuhui.net/).

**Thanks!**

## Usage
1. Download the basic modpack from `Actions` and install it.
2. Click `Use this template` to create a new repository.
3. Clone the repository to your local environment.
4. Make sure the repository is in the same directory as your game files.
5. Remember to update `manifest.json` and `modlist.html` in the future when you update your modpack's mod.
